The hotel industry is a highly competitive market, with various factors influencing the booking decisions of customers. In order to stay ahead of the competition, it is essential for hotel management to have a deep understanding of the factors that govern hotel bookings. This project aims to explore and analyze a hotel booking dataset in order to gain insights on the best time of year to book a room, the optimal length of stay for the best daily rate, and any other patterns or trends in the data.

The dataset used in this project contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

The first step in the project will be to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This will involve cleaning and preprocessing the data, as well as visualizing the data to gain a better understanding of the underlying patterns and trends. For example, we can analyze the booking data over time to identify the busiest months for the hotel and the times of year when bookings are slow. We can also look at the length of stay for bookings to determine the optimal length of stay for the best daily rate. By doing so, hotel management can make decision to offer discounts or promotions during slow seasons to increase bookings.

Data exploration and visualization will be the main focus of the project. We will use various techniques such as histograms, bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and uncover patterns and trends. We will also use statistical techniques such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to summarize the data and make sense of it.

The insights and recommendations generated from this project will be valuable for hotel management and marketing strategies. For example, if the analysis shows that bookings are slow during certain months of the year, the hotel can offer promotions or discounts during these months to increase bookings. Similarly, if the analysis shows that the optimal length of stay for the best daily rate is 3 nights, the hotel can offer special packages to encourage customers to book a 3-night stay.

In conclusion, this project aims to gain valuable insights on the factors that govern hotel bookings by exploring and analyzing a hotel booking dataset. The project will use EDA techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the data, rather than building any predictive models. The insights and recommendations generated from this project will be beneficial for hotel management and marketing strategies, helping the hotel to stay ahead of the competition and increase bookings. By understanding the patterns and trends in the data, hotel management can make informed decisions to improve their hotel's performance.
